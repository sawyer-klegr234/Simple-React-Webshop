# Simple React shop

### Notes
-	I used Preact/Vite to get up and running quickly as it is very light and quick to setup, and does not have any limitations that negatively will impact the project.
-	I used npm-watch to for hot-reload during development.

### Running the web app
    1. Clone the git repo
    2. Navigate to the root folder and run `npm install`
    3. Run `npm run watch dev` to build and run the web app, then navigate to the IP/port specified by Vite. I have only setup a dev script for the time being as it is adequate to launch and test the web app.
